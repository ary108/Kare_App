Written mainly in Java using Android Studio. 

My mother runs a childcare program, and often faces the issue that many parents want a detailed report about their day, but there isn’t the time to debrief them. She elaborated that “If I had some way of digitally creating a report and sending it to the parents, it would save me a lot of time, since I could make the report whenever I have free time, and the parents get a detailed report of everything they need to know”. 

Therefore, I wrote a app that can create digital behavior management reports and profiles, can save and retrieve them, and save the report as a pdf, along with user authentication.
